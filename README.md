Web app for tracking statistics on books I have read.
Prototype is functional, but very much a work in progress. 

# TO-DO
- Add login button to generic html template.
- Intuitively display aggregate statistics instead of only listing information of individual book instances.
- Allow user to add new books via the application (no reliance on admin page)
- Populate database using Wikipedia API
