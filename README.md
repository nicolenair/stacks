Web app for tracking statistics on books I have read.
Prototype can be run via python manage.py runserver, but is very much a work in progress/draft stage. 

# Tasks
- [ ] Add login button to generic html template.
- [ ] Intuitively display aggregate statistics instead of only listing information of individual book instances.
- [ ] Allow user to add new books via the application (no reliance on admin page)
- [ ] Populate database using Wikipedia API
